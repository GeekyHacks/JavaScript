        <strong>General Notes </strong>
        <li>
          variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If
          you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result
          will be NaN which means "Not a Number".
        </li>
        <li>
            const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus 
            that variables declared using const are read-only. They are 
            a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, 
            it cannot be reassigned
        </li>

        <li>
            The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
            Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as 
            the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not
             work properly with negative numbers.
